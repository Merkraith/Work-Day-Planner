# Work-Day-Planner


## Introduction

My project here is a Work-Day Planner that allows the user to write notes for each hour of the work day, to help manage their time.

It's a simple application that can save the use of paper memos on a daily basis and help keep one more organized with daily work tasks.

## Instructions and Features

To use this planner, all you need is to visit the link (see below) and view it on your browser.  It will be different for every user because the notes you save, save to your "Local Storage" in your devices browser.  

You can refresh the page, close it, and it will still be there the next time you load the page.   To clear it out for the next day, simply just click the clear button.

The planner also tracks in real time thanks to an api from "moment.js".  When the page is loaded it will display the current date and time.  

While an hour is active in real time, the text field will be displayed in the color **RED**. Once an hour has passed it will be displayed in the color **GRAY**.  Hours that have not happened yet will display in the color **GREEN**.
